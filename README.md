This software augments
[Outpost Packet Message Manager](https://www.outpostpm.org),
adding forms that are used for emergency communication by ARES in Los Altos, California.
It uses the [add-on interface](http://www.outpostpm.org/docs/Outpost320-AddonUG.pdf)
to Outpost, and a web browser to display and edit forms.

To install, download an OutpostForLAARES*.exe file from
https://github.com/jmkristian/OutpostForLAARES/releases
and execute it.
After installation is complete, exit and restart Outpost.

Uninstall as you would any program.
For example on Windows 8, open the control panel "Programs and Features",
right click "Outpost for LAARES" and click "Uninstall".
After uninstallation is complete, exit and restart Outpost.

For a
[silent install](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Which_command_line_parameters_can_be_used_to_configure_installers),
execute the installer with option `/S`.
To specify an installation folder, add the option `/D=C:\YourFolder`.
The /D= option must be last, and the folder name must not be surrounded by quotes.
Beware: a folder name that contains whitepsace won't work with Outpost version 3.2 c118.
For a silent uninstall, execute `.\uninstall.exe /S` in the folder where the program was installed.

Building
--------

Source code is stored in [this repository](https://github.com/jmkristian/OutpostForLAARES).
To build it, you'll need
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
a bash shell (the one included with Git for Windows is sufficient),
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 4 (yes that old),
and [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net) version 3.

Clone this repository and then use bash to run ./build.sh in your clone.

The installer source code is setup.nsi, and
the source for most of the installed code is bin/launch.js.

Developing
----------

Most improvements to the web user interface will be done in
[pack-it-forms](https://github.com/jmkristian/pack-it-forms/blob/LAARES/README.md)
(not this repository).
You can experiment by cloning pack-it-forms into your clone of this repository (as a sub-folder).
When you're done experimenting, release pack-it-forms and then use the new released version here.
That is, commit changes to pack-it-forms, push them to GitHub, release pack-it-forms,
remove your experimental pack-it-forms sub-folder, build a new installer, test it,
push changes to GitHub and create a new release including the new installer.

To develop another add-on, create an <addon>.launch file in the addons sub-folder.
Other configuration files will be generated by bin/launch.js#installConfigFiles.
